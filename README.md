# Check Yo' Self

## Introduction
Check Yo' Self is the second solo project and also the last project of Module 1 at Turing. My instructors gave me a comp with specific desktop and mobile designs plus a functionality comp with different phases to complete. In order to complete this project I has to use semantic HTML, CSS, and two JavaScript files. One JS file for my 'ToDoList' class and a main.js file to handle most of my functionality.
