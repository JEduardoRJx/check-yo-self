## Introduction
Check Yo' Self is the second solo project and also the last project of Module 1 at Turing. My instructors gave me a comp with specific desktop and mobile designs plus a functionality comp with different phases to complete. In order to complete this project I has to use semantic HTML, CSS, and two JavaScript files. One JS file for my 'ToDoList' class and a main.js file to handle most of my functionality.

## Learning Goals
My learning goals consisted of solidifying my understanding of semantic HTML, clean and organized CSS styles, DRY JavaScript, localStorage, use of and manipulation of DOM elements, and ability to recreate a UI with great UX.

## Overview
Check Yo' Self is a To Do List web app that lets users organize all their todo's. User's will be able to create a todo list via a form by entering a title and different tasks that relate. The user can delete a task if they chose to. Once a task is made they will see it a card displayed with their title and tasks plus checkboxes they can mark off. A card will also display an urgent icon that lets users mark which todo lists are most urgent. Only when all the tasks are complete can they delete the todo list card.
